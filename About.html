            "I am very passionate about my work Because I love what I do, I have developed a good motivation that drives me to do my best in all my work.
             In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, 
             I taught myself how to use Azure Cloud in different scenerios. I soon became the Associate and Operations Range for the cloud."
